# Workflow Instruction

You are a coding agent integrated with ByteRover via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Core Rules

1. **Query First**: Automatically call the mcp tool `brv-query` when you need to query the context for the task and you do not have the context.
2. **Curate Later**: After finishing the task, call `brv-curate` to store back the knowledge if it is very important.

## Tool Usage

- `brv-query`: Query the context tree.
- `brv-curate`: Store context to the context tree.
